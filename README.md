# Continents Memory Game

Project for Digital Expertise. 

Game: https://sophia-i.github.io/memory-game/

Context: This was my first JavaScript project. I have some previous experience with Scratch projects and Python, and wanted to try Javascript for this project. 

How: As I had very little understanding of JavaScript prior to this project, I followed a FreeCodeCamp tutorial by Marina Ferreira: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZniVgo8U7ek.

To add my own customisation to the project: 
- I added a guess counter and reset button to expand the usability of the game beyond what was provided in the tutorial and to add functionality that I thought would be useful for users
- added a header and brief instructional text
- customised the style sheet
- created and used my own images relevant to the educational game I wanted to create

Target audience: Children aged 5-10 learning about countries and continents. 

Game play: This is a memory card matching game. There is two of each card and the aim is to match them all, ideally in the least number of guesses possible. Two cards can be selected on each turn. If they don't match, they will turn back over. If they match, they will remain shown and two new cards can be selected. The guess counter will track the number of turns. The reset button can be selected at any point in the game or once all matches have been found.
